This project is just for practice. I am using it to learn and master GitHub and version control while simultaneously revising and extending my c++ knowledge.
It is a Todo List manager where users add their tasks via the terminal and then marks whether or not a specific task from their list is completed or not.
For the time being it is a very simple project without any persistence but as time goes, I will be adding features and refactoring the code and update the README.
